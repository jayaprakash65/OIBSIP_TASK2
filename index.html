            <h2>Career and Contributions</h2>
            <p>Subhas Chandra Bose played a crucial role in the Indian National Congress during the 1920s and 1930s. He advocated for complete independence from British rule and criticized the non-violent approach of Mahatma Gandhi. Bose believed in direct action and organized mass protests, strikes, and boycotts to challenge British authority.</p>
            <p>During World War II, Bose sought assistance from the Axis powers to liberate India from British rule. He established the INA, which consisted of Indian prisoners of war and civilians in Southeast Asia. The INA waged a military campaign against the British, aiming to liberate India. Bose's charismatic leadership and his famous speeches, such as the "Give me blood, and I shall give you freedom" speech, inspired thousands of Indians to join the struggle for independence.</p>
            <p>Although Bose's efforts to liberate India militarily were not ultimately successful, his contributions and sacrifices for the cause of Indian independence remain an integral part of the country's history.</p>
